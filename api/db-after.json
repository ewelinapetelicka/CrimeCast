He taunted police and media with letters detailing his crimes, evading capture for decades. Rader was arrested in 2005 after DNA evidence linked him to the murders. He was convicted of ten counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to ten consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. His case raised concerns about the psychological motives of serial killers and their manipulation of law enforcement.",

      "bio":"Marcel Petiot was a French serial killer and physician active during World War II. He gained notoriety as 'Doctor Satan' for his gruesome murders, where he would lure victims, often seeking asylum from the Nazi regime, to his home in Paris. Petiot's victims were promised safety and escape, but instead, they met a horrific fate. His trial in 1946 revealed the extent of his brutality, and he was ultimately executed for his crimes.",
